**Backend Engineer | Building products that matter**
___

I lead remote product development and operations teams focusing on enterprise network applications. Trained in backend, web and frontend engineering at Codecademy and Tripleten, I can deliver projects across the entire stack. My experience in SaaS operations has taught me the value of combining clear communication with technical expertise, enabling me to deliver reliable, user-focused software that balances quality and simplicity.

<br>

I have used these tools and frameworks in my most recent projects (last 6 months or so):

- Celery and Redis (Python) in a Heroku server to integrate Hubspot, PhantomBuster (Linkedin), Apollo.io and ContactOut.
- Claude Haiku 3.5, AWS Bedrock (Knowledge Bases, Agents and Workflows) in the AWS environment (Lambdas, API Gateway, CloudWatch and Layers) to create a Hubspot AI Agent.
- Plain JavaScript and OpenAI API calls in n8n workflows to identify, merge and enrich contacts in Hubspot.
